I feel like getting ignant’
Why I say ignant’? Ignant’
Ignorant, ignat’
Ignorant, ignat’
Ignorant, ignat’
Ignorant
Whatever the fuck do you call it
Whatever the fuck do you call it
Ay, lemme stop playing

Cash or credit, I take both
I get dirty money, might need soap
Summertime still a cold world
So I walk around in a peacoat
Don’t interfere with my gangsta
Saw mo’ money than a banker
Ain’t no therapy for my anger
’Cause I’ll put the therapist in danger

Original bitch, who don’t take no one’s shit
If them niggas start buggin’, I raid they shit
In other words, I spray they shit
Whip a bitch ass, I Nae Nae shit
I chase your confession, I am the connection
I’m bodying niggas just out of perfection
Witness protection should be his direction
Known to cut up like a fucking C-Section

quick thought
(Ooh, ooh) quick thought
I should take a nigga chips then dip off
Matter of fact, take a nigga chips with a dip sauce
If a nigga talk, take his lip off
Shine on hoes like lip gloss

Trigger happy when I let the clip off
R.I.P., that nigga like a rip off
Fuck back and forth like a swing
’Cause I don’t talk, I just swing
Bars doper than Charlie Sheen
Couple shots, you gon’ lean
Not talking liquor, slowmo
I’m gone snap like a fucking photo
Rich neighbors gon’ call the popo
Like, "Oh my God, oh no!" (scary ass, scary ass)

That’s what happen when you fuck with a goon
The Draco go loony more than Looney Toons
Up in the sky, all you see is balloons
For more opps, we can link up at noon
Drawing on y’all, but not into graffitti
Never argue with someone who beneath me
You got Yeezys, but them bitches look sleepy
Tired as fuck from you wearing them weekly

Dirty little broad in a dirty bra
Bet a mill’ that you not going far
But to the car for a cigarette (cigarette)
Glove compartment, might live a rat
Hoes breath stank, need they liver check
Gotta watch hoes, I need a sitter check
Why worry now when I been a threat?
Since a shorty getting drunk off Similac

Ruger, Ruger, Ruger, riding with me in a Uber
If I smell something fishy on the opps
I’ma take they bread and make tuna
I shoot like a trained shooter
Strip a nigga naked like Hooters
Rug covered up in blood leaking through the floor
Let me call Luna

I’m a handful, so use both hands
These two hands will kill both mens
Fuck a yes man, need a no man
I open more doors than a doorman for these rappers, actors
These are real factors, still haven’t met no competition
’Cause none of y’all hoes matter

That makeup do not match yo’ skin tone
I’m wondering what the fuck went wrong
That Yaki is older than flip phones
Don’t take it out now, it shoulda been gone
Work all day, fuck a shift, traffic all day like Lyft
Call me Emily Elizabeth, I got a chopper bigger than Cliff

Walk in the park, this shit a walk in the park
Bitch, you not hard
Probably run from the sound of a fart, hey
Walk in the park, this shit a walk in the park
Bitch, you not hard
Probably run from the sound of a fart
Bitch ass, bitch ass, bitch ass, bitch ass, bitch ass
