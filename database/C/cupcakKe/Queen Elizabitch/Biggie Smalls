Instagram hoes shouldn’t be y’all goals (nah)
Look past the post, she photoshopped her rolls (yeah)
Filter so bright she don’t think black glows (why?)
That 30 inch weave is to cover her back rolls (yeah)

It’s shockin’ to you but not to me (not to me)
People turnin’ insecurities to mockeries (to mockeries)
Shit, I could be thin or overweight, won’t bother me (it won’t)
I’m still choose Burger King over broccoli

I love every inch of my body, don’t compare me to shawty
Size 7 or 11, I’m a still be a hottie
I dial 0 to the lobby, chop up my steak like karate
Send it up with ten cups ’cause I drink pop like a hobby

I’m thinkin’ rooftop party, hell yeah, it’s ’bout to go up (go up)
’Til shorty put her finger down her mouth, she tryna throw up (throw up)
So she won’t gain weight from listenin’ to the hate
Can’t give her food for thought
She’ll think her brain gainin’ weight

Eatin’ disorders, scarier than horrors (yeah, yeah)
She in a buffet and only order a water
Yeah, it’s that cray, it make you fight yo’ craves
Stretch marks in a bikini, I’m that damn brave

I used to think model type meant skinny as fuck
’Til Ashley Graham came through and started fuckin’ shit up (shit up)
On cover after cover with no tummy tuck
Straight served with her curves and got her money up

Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (call it)
Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (call it)
Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (call it)
Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (call it)

Medium, big or small, I love you all (love you)
Big or small, I love you all (love you)
Big or small, I love you all (love you)
Big or small, it’s who you are

Small, medium, large, extra large, and 4X
Size is just size, one ain’t better than the next (nah)
Reachin’ for my food is the only time I stretch
Can’t you see I love me, and I’m feelin’ my best? (Oh yeah)

Confidence on ten, I can’t break like commercials
Try again and again, like you in rehearsal (try)
Stripes on my body lookin’ like Tony the Tiger (woo)
Shit so fire, everybody inspired (woo)

Body of all shapes, no difference, they all great
I’m eatin’ out the pot if you make me a small plate
You could call me fat or anythin’ under the sun (I don’t care)
Afterwards, I’ma still go buy a honeybun (yep)

Idolize the wrong ones, man, it’s clear as day
Go to doctors to get implants, but they rent ain’t paid (shame)
Straight up, fuck dude if he don’t like small boobs
Manipulatin’ yo’ mind like he been to law school

Give him the boot like thigh highs, tell that nigga, "Bye-bye"
Nigga point my flaws out, we ’bout to play I Spy
I spy a nigga with a big ass head
And we ain’t talkin’ about that one between his legs

If you ain’t got no ass, just hit a couple squats (yeah)
Ain’t no need for a doc to inject butt shots (fuck that)
Don’t turn to the media lookin’ for what’s hot
They’ll steer yo’ ass wrong like drivers drinkin’ Cîroc (skrrt)

Epic fail on the scale, but she still lookin’ swell
Gotta get well be like a snail come up outta that shell
Think she big like a whale the other think she too frail
Both gotta understand that they gorgeous as hell

Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (call it)
Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (call it)
Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (call it)
Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (call it)

Medium, big or small, I love you all (love you)
Big or small, I love you all (love you)
Big or small, I love you all (love you)
Big or small, it’s who you are

Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (call it)
Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (call it)
Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (call it)
Call it Biggie Smalls, call it Biggie Smalls (call it)

Medium, big or small, I love you all (love you)
Big or small, I love you all (love you)
Big or small, I love you all (love you)
Big or small, it’s who you are
